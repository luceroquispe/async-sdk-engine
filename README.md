# Async-Requester

This is a wrapper around httpx and trio for making python requests easier and default to async.

The returned objects are a list of httpx responses.

## Quickstart

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) then run:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m src.main
```

## Why

Autogenerated sdks are difficult to build and maintain. Take control of your sdk and default to async.

For example say you have a complex api endpoint requirement. So many possible mistakes. Define the pydantic schema in [src/schema.py](/src/schema.py) then update [src/api.py](/src/api.py) and bobs your aunty - you have an async sdk!

## Testing

```bash
poetry run python -m pytest
```

## Static typing

```bash
poetry run mypy .
```

## Nice to have

* [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) formatted
* mypy compliant
* Modern http and async libraries ([httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) and [trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) respectively)
